# Crop-Recommender
This is a repository containing the basics of a crop recommender tool, which is part of a larger project to aid farmers in India. Using a feed-forward neural network, one amongst 32 crops can be recommended to a user of this tool. This recommender currently only works for the crops of Karnataka. 

## Notes
- Based on a user's location, and time of year, the crop is selected. 
- This engine takes into consideration details such as fertilizer rates, water availability, soil type for the district etc and suggests the most viable crop
- Jupyter Notebook is a requirement for running the .ipynb file
- Dataset has been scraped using Karnataka government websites such as http://raitamitra.kar.nic.in/KAN/index.asp. I do not claim ownership of the dataset in any way. 

## Execution Instructions 
1. Open Jupyter Notebook
2. Once cloned, open the .ipynb file
3. Run each cell, and set up neural network as intended.
